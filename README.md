## Web Application Title
Taqwa Travel – Shariah-Compliant Travel Planner

## Introduction
Traveling is a universal activity that bridges cultures, fosters understanding, and creates lasting memories. However, for Muslim travelers, finding accommodations, dining options, and prayer facilities that align with Islamic principles can be a significant challenge. The lack of easily accessible information on Shariah-compliant services often leads to inconvenience and limits their ability to enjoy travel experiences to the fullest.

## Objective of Security Enhancements
Explain why security hardening is required.

## Web Application Security Enhancements

### 1. Input Validation
Input validation is implemented on both client-side using HTML5 validation attributes and server-side using Laravel request validation to ensure only valid and safe input is processed by the system.
- Client-side validation (login.blade.php)
  ```html
  <div class="mb-4">
                    <label for="email" class="block text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">{{ __('Email') }}</label>
                    <input id="email" type="email" name="email" required autofocus
                           class="login-input"> <!-- Updated class -->
                </div>

                <div class="mb-4">
                    <label for="password" class="block text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">{{ __('Password') }}</label>
                    <input id="password" type="password" name="password" required
                           class="login-input"> <!-- Updated class -->
                </div>

                <div class="block mb-0">
                    <label for="remember_me" class="flex items-center space-x-2">
                        <input id="remember_me" type="checkbox" name="remember" class="mr-2">
                        <span class="text-sm text-gray-600">{{ __('Remember me') }}</span>
                    </label>
                </div>

                <div class="flex items-center justify-between">
                    @if (Route::has('password.request'))
                        <a href="{{ route('password.request') }}" class="text-sm text-indigo-600 hover:text-indigo-800">
                            {{ __('Forgot your password?') }}
                        </a>
                    @endif

                    <button type="submit" class="login-button">
                        {{ __('Log in') }}
                    </button>
                </div>
  ```
- Server-side validation (RegisteredUserController.php)
  ```php
  $validated = $request->validate([
                'name' => ['required', 'string', 'max:255'],
                'email' => ['required', 'string', 'email', 'max:255', 'unique:users'],
                'password' => ['required', 'string', 'min:8', 'confirmed'],
            ]);
  ```

### 2. Authentication
Authentication is enhanced by implementing secure password hashing and session regeneration upon successful login, following Laravel authentication best practices.
- Password Hashing (RegisteredUserController.php)
    ```php
     $user = User::create([
                'name' => $validated['name'],
                'email' => $validated['email'],
                'password' => Hash::make($validated['password']),
            ]);
    ```
- Login Authentication (AuthenticatedSessionController.php)
  ```php
  public function store(Request $request)
   {
      // Validate the login credentials
      $credentials = $request->only('email', 'password');
    
      // Attempt to log in the user
      if (Auth::attempt($credentials)) {
          // Regenerate the session to protect against session fixation
          $request->session()->regenerate();
    
           // Redirect the user to the home page
           return redirect()->intended('/');
      }
    
      // If authentication fails, redirect back with an error message
      return back()->withErrors([
           'email' => 'The provided credentials do not match our records.',
       ]);
   }
  ```
### 3. Authorization
Authorization controls are implemented using Laravel middleware and role-based checks to ensure users can only access resources permitted to their roles. As shown in *web.php*,
```php
Route::middleware([
    'auth:sanctum',
    config('jetstream.auth_session'),
    'verified',
])->group(function () {
    Route::get('/dashboard', function () {
        return view('dashboard');
    })->name('dashboard');
});
```

### 4. XSS and CSRF Prevention
Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) is prevented through escaped Blade output, while Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks are mitigated using Laravel’s built-in CSRF token mechanism. As shown in *login.blade.php*,
```html
@csrf
<div class="mb-4">
    <label for="email" class="block text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">{{ __('Email') }}</label>
    <input id="email" type="email" name="email" required autofocus
        class="login-input"> <!-- Updated class -->
</div>

<div class="mb-4">
    <label for="password" class="block text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">{{ __('Password') }}</label>
    <input id="password" type="password" name="password" required
        class="login-input"> <!-- Updated class -->
</div>

<div class="block mb-0">
    <label for="remember_me" class="flex items-center space-x-2">
    <input id="remember_me" type="checkbox" name="remember" class="mr-2">
        <span class="text-sm text-gray-600">{{ __('Remember me') }}</span>
    </label>
 </div>

<div class="flex items-center justify-between">
    @if (Route::has('password.request'))
        <a href="{{ route('password.request') }}" class="text-sm text-indigo-600 hover:text-indigo-800">
        {{ __('Forgot your password?') }}
        </a>
     @endif

    <button type="submit" class="login-button">
    {{ __('Log in') }}
     </button>
</div>
```
### 5. Database Security
#### 5.1 Initial Security Audit & Vulnerability Identification
An audit was conducted on multiple controllers including AuthenticatedSessionController, BookingController, DestinationController, and RegisteredUserController. User inputs such as URL parameters, form submissions, and request payloads were analyzed for unsafe database interactions.

##### 5.1.1 Identify Injection Point
|     Features      |   Controller  |    input     | 
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
|1. Login  | AuthenticedSessionController | email, password |
|2. Registration | RegisteredUserController | name, email, password |
|3. Booking | BookingController | booking id |
|4. Destination view | DestinationController | destination id |
|5. Search | DestinationController | search parameters

##### 5.1.2 Test for SQL Injection
- **Error exposure** <br>
  payload: ' <br>
  Result:
  ![login attemp](https://github.com/amirmstqm/Web-Sec-Project/blob/main/images/screenshot-%20login%20attemp.png)
  -  no SQL error shown
  -  Laravel generic error handling

- **Authentication Bypass** <br>
  payload: ' OR '1'='1' -- <br>
  Result:<img width="1690" height="890" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7a2b98c1-243d-4694-9c88-900975312eb4" />
  - login failed
  - no unauthorized access

- **URL Parameter Injection**<br>
payload: http://127.0.0.1:8000/login/destination/5' <br>
Result: ![urlpaylaod](https://github.com/amirmstqm/Web-Sec-Project/blob/main/images/screenshot-url%20parameter%20injection.png)

- **Analyze vulnerability**<br>
  Manual SQL Injection testing was conducted by injecting common payloads into the login form and URL parameters. The application rejected all injection attempts. No SQL errors or system information were displayed, and authentication bypass was unsuccessful as shown in  *AuthenticatedSessionController.php*<b>
  
  ```php
   public function store(Request $request)
    {
        // Validate the login credentials
        $credentials = $request->only('email', 'password');

        // Attempt to log in the user
        if (Auth::attempt($credentials)) {
            // Regenerate the session to protect against session fixation
            $request->session()->regenerate();

            // Redirect the user to the home page
            return redirect()->intended('/');
        }

        // If authentication fails, redirect back with an error message
        return back()->withErrors([
            'email' => 'The provided credentials do not match our records.',
        ]);
    }
  ```

#### 5.2 Defensive Programming (mitigation)
##### 5.2.1 Parameterized Queries
*DestinationController.php*
```php
$destination = Destination::findOrFail($id);
```
This project already compliant parameterized queries to prevent the SQL injection.

##### 5.2.2 Input Validation (Specific fields)
example from *DestinationController.php*
```php
 $request->validate([
            'destination' => 'required',
            'depart_date' => 'required|date',
            'return_date' => 'required|date|after_or_equal:depart_date',
            'travellers' => 'required|integer|min:1',
            'cabin_class' => 'required|string',
            'filter' => 'nullable|string|in:affordable,expensive',
        ]);
```
#### 5.3 Error Handling & System Information
##### 5.3.1 Disable Detailed Errors









  

### 6. File Security
File security is enforced through strict file validation, secure storage configuration, and protection of sensitive server files to prevent unauthorized access and file leaks.

### Challenges & Difficulties to Develop The Application

- **Time Constraints**: The project had a short time frame for completion, which made it challenging to implement and test all features thoroughly.
- **GitHub Usage**: Some team members faced difficulties with **GitHub**, especially when it came to **pulling** or **pushing** changes, as they were not accustomed to using version control systems.

## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.
